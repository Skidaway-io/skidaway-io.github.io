                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>At Skidaway, we strive to be extremely transparent and fact-based in our approaches. We are also not
                    afraid to think differently or to poke fun at ourselves our crazy ideas. We are also deeply aware of
                    how crucial it is that, together, we start to turn back the tide of increasingly sophisticated cyber
                    attacks.</p>

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Skidaway was founded by a team with diverse experiences including having built security operations
                    teams and broadly deployed enterprise data infrastructure solutions. We came together in 2023 to
                    reimagine cyber security from first principles, committed to changing the game to give more insight
                    and freedom of choice to enterprises while building solutions that adversaries will find are always
                    one step ahead of them.</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Cyber security spending now exceeds $200bn per year. And the costs of cyber attacks now exceed $6trn
                    per year. Meanwhile the cyber security industry, in general, takes a traditional approach to
                    business, selling customers top down into lock-in based products and business models.</p>
